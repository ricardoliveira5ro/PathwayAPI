## üöÄ Getting Started

This section will guide you through using PathwayAPI, including how to authenticate and access the available features.

#### üîê Authentication / Authorization

Each endpoint requires previous authentication based on bearer token. This token can be obtained after sign up and/or login as returned header. The token has 30 days expiration date.

**POST** /signup
```
{
    "user": {
        "email": "[your-email@email.com]",
        "password": "[your-password]",
        "name": "[your-username]"
    }
}
```

**POST** /login
```
{
    "user": {
        "email": "[your-email@email.com]",
        "password": "[your-password]"
